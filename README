                    =============================

    A small script for retrieving the accent color of a given site.
    This is done by calculating the dominant color of the site's favicon,
    which generally gives the expected results. The format of the returned
    color is 'rgb(R, G, B)'.

    Connects to http://g.etfv.co/ (getFavicon by Jason Cartwright) to get favicons.
